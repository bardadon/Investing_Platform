Project Todo list:

# Load Raw Data to Cloud Storage
(Done)Finish with the unit tests
(Later)Extract additional data from different sources about the currencies, full names etc
(Later)Try to extract enough information to have something to play with later on
(Done)Next, load everything to Cloud Storage

# Extract Data from Cloud Storage, process it and load to BigQuery
(Done)Process the rates data so it would be comfortable to work with later on(in sql, matplotlib etc)
(Done)Load to BigQuery
(Later)
    - Think how to make the loading more efficient. The way to do it is by incremental loadings
    - Grab only the latest batch from Fixer.io and load only the records that do not appear in BigQuery

# Visualization
Extract the data from BigQuery(or continue with reading from the CSV files) and build graphs in a simple flask application 
Create several webpages, each one has its own purpose.
Create:
    - home webpage - Explain about the platform.
    -  plots webpage - show a list of the available symbols. Add each symbol will be a button.
        Clicking on each symbol will navigate to plots/<symbol>
    - plots/<symbol> webpage - show a canvas of different plots about that particular symbol.
