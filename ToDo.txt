Unit test ToDo list for the dag: process_rates

Can call function
can read dataframe
can create a new dataframe with a column called rates
can append the first currency from the old dataframe to the new dataframe
can append all of them



Project Todo list:
Finish with the unit tests
Process the rates data so it would be comfortable to work with later on(in sql, matplotlib etc)
Extract additional data from different sources about the currencies, full names etc
Try to extract enough information to have something to play with later on
Next, load everything to Cloud Storage and BigQuery
Extract the data from BigQuery and build graphs in a simple flask application
